# Lucky Stark

Lucky Stark is an innovative on-chain lottery platform that ensures fairness and transparency by leveraging Pragma's VRF (Verifiable Random Function) oracle for true randomness. Users can create or participate in a variety of lotteries, fostering a dynamic and engaging ecosystem.

Additionally, we are working on introducing 1-on-1 betting between users, built on top of Pragma's Optimistic Oracle. This feature guarantees secure, decentralized, and trustless interactions for competitive betting.
